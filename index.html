    <h2>What is Css?</h2>
    <p>1.CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet</p>
    <p>2.CSS describe how html elements are to be displayed on screen, paper or in other media.</p>
    <p>3.<del><b >CSS is not necessary</b></del> <b><mark>  CSS saves lot of work .</mark></b>  it can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once</p>
    <p style="text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic;">4.External stylesheet are stored in  CSS file.</p>
    <h2>CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML element.</li>
    <li>Internal - by using style element in the head section.</li>
    <li>External - by using a link element to link to an external css file .  
    </li>
    <li>The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS file.However,<mark><b> in this tutorial we will use inline and internal style</b></mark> , because this is easier to demonstrate , and easier for you to try it yourself.</li>
</ul>
     
    
    <p>When comparing css class vs Id, the difference is that css class applies a style to multiple elements. ID , on the other hand, applies a style to one unique element , ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by javascript</p>
<p>In CSS, selectrors are used to target a specific element of range of elements in a webpage. Once a element has been taargeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the element.</p> 
<p>There is a wide range of selectors available. Two of the most commonly used are class and ID . Both are to target elements to which style should be applied.</p>
